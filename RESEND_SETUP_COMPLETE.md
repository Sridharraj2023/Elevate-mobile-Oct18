## 🔧 **What Changed in Email Service**

### **Before (nodemailer + Gmail):**
```javascript
import nodemailer from 'nodemailer';

const gmailTransporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  service: 'gmail',
  auth: {
    user: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
    pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASS,
  },
});
```

### **After (Resend):**
```javascript
import { Resend } from 'resend';

const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY);

// Simple, clean API
const { data, error } = await resend.emails.send({
  from: process.env.EMAIL_FROM,
  to: [user.email],
  subject: 'Reset Your Password',
  html: htmlContent,
  text: textContent,
});
```
